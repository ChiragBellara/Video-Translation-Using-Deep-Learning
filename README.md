## Overview
As educational, informational, and entertainment videos become essential tools for learning and communication, language barriers can limit their reach and impact. A video translation system enables content to be understood by a broader audience, regardless of language, promoting inclusivity and ensuring that knowledge and ideas can be shared across cultures. AI-driven translation systems can process vast amounts of video content quickly and efficiently, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with manual translation. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, these systems achieve high levels of accuracy and contextual awareness, preserving the nuances and intent of the original content.

This project focuses on developing an automated system that uses deep learning techniques to translate videos from one language to another. The process involves extracting audio from the video, performing speech recognition to convert spoken words into text, translating that text into the desired language, generating new audio from the translation, and then seamlessly merging it with the original video.

## Features
- Support for YouTube URLs and direct video file uploads
- Speech recognition powered by OpenAI Whisper
- Multiple machine translation options, including Google Translate, Azure AI Translator, and MyMemory
- Text-to-speech generation using Bark by Suno
- Basic voice cloning capabilities
- Seamless audio-video synchronization
- Intuitive and user-friendly web interface
