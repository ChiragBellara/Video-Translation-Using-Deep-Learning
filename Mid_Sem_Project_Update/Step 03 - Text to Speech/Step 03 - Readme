This module would be used for converting Text to Speech. I have currently used suno-bark(https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) as it uses transformer for the voice and supports 13 languages.
As a video can have lengthy speech I have also experimented with using nltk to splitting the text extracted from a long video into sentences. These sentences are then processed one by one and then eventually merged as one comple .wav file outcome.

This module needs to work as an API getting the speech and outputting the audio file for desired language.
