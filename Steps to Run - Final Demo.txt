Open the Video_Translation_Final_Demo.ipynb in Google Colab
Download the Flask App folder from the repo
Run the Final Demo until the cell which creates the templates and static folder
    It has commands that look like this
    checkAndMakeDir('/content/templates')
    checkAndMakeDir('/content/static')

Now, once the templates folder is created in '/content', 
upload all the files from Flask App templates folder to this templates folder
Next, to upload the static files, we need to first upload the zip folder of assets.
Running the next cell should prompt you to upload the assets zip folder to Colab
The commands that follow, basically unzip the assets folder and place it in the /content/static folder
Also, upload the styles.css file to this folder.

Next you have to get a NGROK auth token. 
See https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup to generate the Auth Token

Once all this is done, you can run the remaining cells.
